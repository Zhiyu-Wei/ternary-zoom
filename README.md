# focused-ternary-plot

A flexible and focused ternary plot function for compositional data visualization in R.

Unlike traditional ternary plotting tools like [`ggtern`](https://github.com/hdrake/ggtern), which always show the full triangle, this function adapts the plot area to match **the actual data region**. It is especially useful when your compositions are concentrated in a small area of the triangle.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Works with any 3-part compositional data (e.g., sleep/exercise/other, macronutrients, soil types)
- âœ… Automatically adapts the triangle to your data's support
- âœ… Optional red boundary lines show the exact area where data exists
- âœ… Color mapping for predicted or measured values
- âœ… Fully `ggplot2`-based â€” no need for external packages like `ggtern`

Why not use ggtern?
The ggtern package is great, but it has one major limitation:

It always displays the entire triangle, even when your data occupies only a small region.

This function solves that by:

Zooming into the actual data region

Making patterns and clusters easier to see

Saving space in reports or dashboards


ðŸ”§ Arguments

| Argument        | Type                            | Description                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data`          | `data.frame` or `matrix`        | A 3-column composition dataset. Each row should sum to 1 (or nearly 1).                                             |
| `pred`          | `numeric vector`                | A response variable to be mapped as color (e.g., prediction, measurement). Must match the number of rows in `data`. |
| `lab.title`     | `character`                     | The title shown on the plot.                                                                                        |
| `show_boundary` | `logical`                       | Whether to draw the red boundary lines that reflect the data range. Default is `FALSE`.                             |
| `scale_color`   | `character vector (length = 2)` | Two colors for gradient scale (low to high). Default is `c("yellow", "blue")`.                                      |
