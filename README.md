# ðŸŽ¯ focused-ternary-plot

A flexible and focused ternary plot function for compositional data visualization in R.

Unlike traditional ternary plotting tools like [`ggtern`](https://github.com/hdrake/ggtern), which always show the full triangle, this function adapts the plot area to match **the actual data region**. It is especially useful when your compositions are concentrated in a small area of the triangle.
